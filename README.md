Team 4 Trojan Horses proudly presents our very humble AI Chatbot. We are all beginners who just started learning coding and about machine learning - so this chatbot is intentionally very simple and only understands a small set of predefined & specified questions. 
The chatbot uses a small PyTorch neural network trained on phrases defined in intents.json. It will only respond CORRECTLY to those patterns. Anything else might result in confusion. 

We are indebted to patrickloeber’s chatbot tutorial, which was our life-saver and guided us through the model structure, training loop and NLP processing. 

Though very simple, this project does have potential with more data-training.
