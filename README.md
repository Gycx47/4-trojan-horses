Team 4 Trojan Horses proudly presents our very humble friendly AI Chatbot. We are all beginners who just started learning coding and about machine learning - so this chatbot is intentionally very simple and only understands a small set of predefined & specified questions. 
The chatbot uses a small PyTorch neural network trained on phrases defined in intents.json. It will only respond CORRECTLY to those patterns. Anything else might result in confusion. 

We are indebted to patrickloeber’s chatbot tutorial, which was our life-saver and guided us through the model structure, training loop and NLP processing. 

Though very simple, this project does have potential with more data-training.

HOW TO USE THE CHATBOT:
*ensure all requirements.txt is installed
Run train.py code
Run chat.py code
YEAHHH!!! Now you can start chatting with the AI Chatbot in the terminal space:)
You can type in prompts from intents.json


HERE ARE SOME OF THE STUFF YOU ASK THE CHATBOT <3
- what are some myths about carbs?
- what are healthy swaps i can do?
- are detox diets healty?
- Help me lose weight?
Basically if you want to DEBUNK MISINFO, NEED RELEVANT AND ACCURATE INFO, this friendly AI chatbot is at your service.
